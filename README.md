**Super cool AI thingy!**

Run main.py to use it.

Here's how to run test mode:

1. Give the program a paragraph
2. the AI will guess the paragraph's subject.
   
Thats it!
If the AI guesses wrong, you can tell it the correct answer. (This will improve results.)

Train mode lets you input a a paragraph with a given subject. This is just meant to give the AI some information.
