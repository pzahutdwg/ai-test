**Super Cool AI Thingy!**

Run main.py to use it.

Here's how to run test mode:

1. Give the program a paragraph
2. the AI will guess the paragraph's subject.
   
Thats it!
If the AI guesses wrong, you can tell it the correct answer. (This will improve results.)

Train mode lets you input a a paragraph with a given subject. This is just meant to give the AI some information.

**Auto Train**

(7/17/2025)
I added an auto trainer to automatically fill the data. All you do is run `autoTrain.py`. You input how many articles you want, and it trains the ai on that amount of randomly-selected Wikipedia pages.
